# Pizza, Pasta, and Lasagna Website

This is a simple website project featuring three classic Italian dishes: pizza, pasta, and lasagna. The website consists of an index page (`index.html`) and three additional files connected to it, each focusing on one of the dishes.

## Files

1. **index.html**: This is the main page of the website. It provides an overview of the three dishes and serves as the entry point to the site.

2. **pizza.html**: This file contains detailed information about pizza, including its history, types of pizza, and popular toppings.

3. **pasta.html**: This file provides information about various types of pasta, pasta dishes from different regions of Italy, and tips for cooking pasta perfectly.

4. **lasagna.html**: This file offers insights into the beloved Italian dish lasagna, including its ingredients, layering techniques, and baking instructions.

## Usage

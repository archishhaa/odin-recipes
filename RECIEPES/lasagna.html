    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>

    <p>
        Lasagna is a popular Italian dish known for its rich and hearty layers. It is a type of baked pasta casserole made by alternating layers of wide, flat pasta sheets with various fillings and sauces. Here’s a detailed description:
    </p>
    <p>
        1. <strong>Pasta Layers</strong>:<br>
        - The pasta used in lasagna is broad and flat, traditionally made from durum wheat. These sheets are often pre-cooked before layering or used in a no-boil form that softens during baking.
    </p>
    <p>
        2. <strong>Sauce</strong>:<br>
        - <strong>Bolognese Sauce</strong>: A classic lasagna features a meat-based sauce known as Bolognese. This sauce typically includes ground beef or pork (sometimes a combination of both), tomatoes, onions, garlic, carrots, celery, and herbs such as basil and oregano. The meat sauce is simmered for several hours to develop a rich, deep flavor.<br>
        - <strong>Béchamel Sauce</strong>: Another traditional component is the béchamel sauce, a white sauce made from butter, flour, and milk. It adds a creamy texture and complements the robust flavor of the meat sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        3. <strong>Cheese</strong>:<br>
        - Lasagna is generously layered with cheese, which can vary depending on the recipe. Common cheeses include mozzarella, ricotta, and Parmesan. Ricotta cheese is often mixed with eggs and herbs to create a rich, creamy layer. Mozzarella provides a gooey, stretchy texture, while Parmesan adds a sharp, tangy flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        4. <strong>Layering</strong>:<br>
        - The assembly of lasagna involves layering these components in a specific order. Typically, it starts with a thin layer of sauce at the bottom of the baking dish to prevent sticking. This is followed by a layer of pasta sheets, then meat sauce, béchamel sauce (if used), and cheese. This process is repeated, often for three to five layers, ending with a generous topping of cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
        5. <strong>Baking</strong>:<br>
        - Once assembled, the lasagna is baked in the oven until the top is golden and bubbly, usually around 375°F (190°C) for about 45 minutes to an hour. The baking allows the flavors to meld together and the cheese to melt and form a delicious crust.
    </p>
    <p>
        6. <strong>Variations</strong>:<br>
        - There are many variations of lasagna, including vegetarian versions that use spinach, zucchini, mushrooms, or other vegetables instead of meat. Some recipes use different sauces, such as marinara or Alfredo, and there are even variations like seafood lasagna or lasagna made with non-traditional ingredients like pesto or goat cheese.
    </p>
    <p>
        7. <strong>Serving</strong>:<br>
        - Lasagna is typically served hot, straight from the oven. It can be a stand-alone meal due to its richness, but it’s often accompanied by a side salad and bread. It is also a dish that benefits from resting for a few minutes after baking, allowing it to set and making it easier to cut and serve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lasagna is cherished for its comforting, hearty nature and its versatility, making it a favorite in many households and a staple at gatherings and special occasions.
